<h3 align="center">An attempt at making a basic 3D RPG in UE5</h3>

**Concept:**

This is my first serious attempt at making an RPG in UE5, complete with movement, combat, enemies, UI and so on. Many of the mechanics and locomotion are based off the AC franchise, with a few additional ones sprinkled in.

<br>

**My Team:**

I created this alone, loosely following a tutorial to learn more about what the engine can do.

<br>

**My Roles in the process:**

* Design:

  * Game design
 
  * Technical design
    
  * Enemy creation
  
* Development:

	* Gameplay Engineering using blueprints

<br>

**Challenges:**

* Bug fixing:

	* Being somewhat new to UE5 meant that I had to learn how to do bug fixing in blueprints
