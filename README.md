<h3 align="center">An attempt at making a basic 3D RPG in UE5</h3>

**Concept:**

This is my first serious attempt at making an RPG in UE5, complete with movement, combat, enemies, UI and so on. Many of the mechanics and locomotion are based off the AC franchise, with a few additional ones sprinkled in.

<br>

**My Roles in the process:**

* Design:

  * Game design
 
  * Technical design
    
  * Enemy creation
  
* Development:

	* Gameplay Engineering using blueprints

<br>

**Challenges:**

* Bug fixing:

	* Being somewhat new to UE5 meant that I had to learn how to do bug fixing in blueprints

This video showcases all the actions I implemented using animation montages, motion warping, traces and state machines. It contains sprinting, jumping, rolling, vaulting, attacking, locking on, assasinations, picking up items and so on. I have also added some attack combos, inventory UI, mesh equipment slots, health and stamina bars as well. I plan to add experience, levelling up, ranged attacks, shielding and so on.

This video showcases the basic enemy AI that I have implemented using the UE AI components (blackboards, behaviour trees etc). The AI first has a basic patrolling behaviour, but if it sees the player it gains aggro and runs towars the player and attacks them. If you run out of its line of sight, you lose aggro. The enemies are currently very basic, and I plan to add more things like enemy combos, ranged attacks, weapons and damage as well.
